# Clinic-Management-System

This project is based on managing a small scale clinical activities. The main actors in the projects were Front Office, Doctor, Lab Technician and Admin. In the technical part I used Node JS for the backend and used Sequelize ORM for the db management in which I used MySQL dialect, we can switch to any DB because of the ORM. In the front end part the used language is React also the REST API were created using node.

When coming to the functionality part admin can add role and staffs to the system, front office can add patient and assign the patient to the doctor, and the doctor can view the appointments to him and add notes and prescroption and add lab test if required, also he can view the patient medical history, then the lab technician can upload the test result and add new tests and even assign a test to the patient. This is all about the basic funtionality about the system.
